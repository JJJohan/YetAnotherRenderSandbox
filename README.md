# YetAnotherRenderSandbox

Don't get too excited, this is just a personal project to familiarise myself with some modern C++ constructs as well as the Vulkan library as well as the modern concept of mesh shaders.

This is a bit of a learning experience with no real practical end-goal of a publicly viable rendering engine, but nevertheless available for perusing for anyone with a bit of spare time, if they so wish.
